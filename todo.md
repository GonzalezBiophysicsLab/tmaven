# To Do
- popplots are very messed up... needs a rewrite. also prefs don't load.
	- maybe plots just work on .mu, .var etc...?
- pickle export of models fails
- add log widget
- add ND plot mode
	- incude presets
	- include check on different colors and/or ratios
- probably smd should have an 'original order' index ... basically untouched, except when ordered... just to keep track...
