# To Do
- pickle export of models fails
- add log widget
- probably smd should have an 'original order' index ... basically untouched, except when ordered... just to keep track...
- translate autocorrelation plot into new format
- translate source splot into new format? bleh
- add menubar to popplot where you can autoload prefs, reset to default, refresh etc....
- clear data should also clear the trace plot
