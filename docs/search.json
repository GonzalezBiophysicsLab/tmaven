    "text": "Data from a single-molecule experiment are stored in an SMD. These exist in files (HDF5 format) or in memory as an object. This format is slighty different than originally described in: Greenfeld, M., van de Meent, JW., Pavlichin, D.S. et al. Single-molecule dataset (SMD): a generalized storage format for raw and processed single-molecule data. BMC Bioinformatics 16, 3 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-014-0429-4.\n\n\n\nHDF5 file based instead of JSON\nMultiple SMDs can live in the same HDF5 file; each lives as a group within the HDF5 file\nFlexible WRT analysis: results from any analysis should be saved as a sub-group within the particular SMD.\nWhen molecules from different data sources can be combined into the same SMD, the original source is remembered.\nClassifying/grouping molecules is very important for many methods; each molecule in the SMD has an integer to specify the class to which it belongs.\n\n\n\n\nNotes/Non-standard points are put in angle brackets.\n\n\nIn tMAVEN, each maven instance has an maven.smd SMD object, even if there is no data in it. There can only be one at a time in tMAVEN. The parameters in each object are\nmaven.smd.raw : ndarray(NxTxD...) - the data\nmaven.smd.source_index : ndarray(N) - integers specifying the source each molecule came from\nmaven.smd.source_names : list - the names of each sources\nmaven.smd.source_dicts : list - dictionaries with metadata entries for each source\nmaven.smd.smd_dict : dictionary - metadata entries describing smd file\n\nmaven.smd.nmol : int - the value of dataset.raw.shape[0]\nmaven.smd.nt : int - the value of dataset.raw.shape[1]\nmaven.smd.ntime : int - the value of dataset.raw.shape[1]\nmaven.smd.ncolor : int - the value of dataset.raw.shape[2]\nmaven.smd.ncolors : int - the value of dataset.raw.shape[2]\nmaven.smd.ndata - : int - the value of dataset.raw.shape[2:]\n\n\n\nWe save SMD data in HDF5 files. Assume you have an HDF5 file with handle f that contains an SMD entry called ‘my_smd_expt7’. The raw data is stored in the SMD specified places. Any tMAVEN-specific data (e.g., classes, pre- or post-times) are stores in the a separate groupd within the SMD called tmaven.\nf['my_smd_expt7'] : group - this is the SMD2 entry\nf['my_smd_expt7'].attrs['format'] = \"SMD\"\nf['my_smd_expt7'].attrs['date_created'] = &lt;time.ctime() upon creation&gt;\nf['my_smd_expt7'].attrs['date_modified'] = &lt;time.ctime() upon last save&gt;\nf['my_smd_expt7'].attrs['description'] = \"Description of the dataset goes here\"\n\nf['my_smd_expt7/data'] : group - this holds the data\nf['my_smd_expt7/data/raw'] : dataset[int/float/double (nmol,ntime,ndata)] - this is the data for each molecule\nf['my_smd_expt7/data/source_index'] : dataset[int (nmol)] - specifies the source for each molecule\n\nf['my_smd_expt7/sources'] : group - This holds the information about the origin of each molecule (e.g., separate movies)\nf['my_smd_expt7/sources/0'] : group - Information about source 0 in the source_index list\nf['my_smd_expt7/sources/0'] : group - Information about the Nth source in the source_index list\nf['my_smd_expt7/sources/0'].attrs['source_name'] = \"&lt;Description of this source, e.g. movie 12\"&gt;\nf['my_smd_expt7/sources/0'].attrs['&lt;Name for a bit of metadata for this source&gt;'] = \"&lt;the metadata itself&gt;\"\nf['my_smd_expt7/sources/0'].attrs['&lt;Name for another bit of metadata for this source&gt;'] = \"&lt;the metadata itself&gt;\"\n...... more metadata for source 0\nf['my_smd_expt7/sources/1'] : group - information about source 1 in the source_index list\n.... entries for source 1\n.. more sources\n\nf['my_smd_expt7/analysisA'] : group  - this is an example of how you would save an analysis (i.e., within this hdf5 group)\nf['my_smd_expt7/program7result'] : group - each program is responsible for the format/specification beyond this point..."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Possibly the most important feature of tMAVEN is its ability to generate models using various algorithms. Users can also use a variety of plots to assess the performance of those models. For more information on Bayesian inference and use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to model single-molecule data (see Kinz-Thompson, Ray, and Gonzalez 2021). A majority of tMAVEN’s algorithms use HMMs which model a time series as transitioning between discrete states hidden by noise.\n\n\n\nAfter generating a model (see below) tMAVEN shows the idealized trajectory (black line) also called the Viterbi path in black, indicating the most likely state of a molecule at each time point\n\n\n\nNavigating Between Models\nIn running any of these algorithms, it may be useful to also check the log, by navigating to View/Show Log. The parameters of a model can be found here, for example: number of determined states, transition matrix, or state means. When generating a model, tMAVEN will only use “on” traces. Viewing the molecule table (section 2) and using the selection tool (section 3) makes toggling molecules on and off much easier.\nAdditionally, which model is displayed through idealized trajectories may be selected under Modeling/. An individual model can be removed with Modeling/Clear Active or all can be removed with Modeling/Remove Models. Models can be exported or imported as hdf5s with Modeling/Export Active and Modeling/Load Active. If users wish to update the idealized trajectories shown, either after changing pre/post times or including/excluding certain traces, they should click Modeling/Update idealized. Note that this will not update the existing model parameters.\n\n\nGenerating Models\nThere are many models to choose from under Modeling/FRET Modeling. One important aspect of these models is whether or not Model Selection is utilized. Without model selection, the user must know and input the number of states, however, if that number is unknown, some algorithms may determine it themselves (see figure). These papers elaborate on that selection: For vbFRET (Bronson et al. 2009) and ebFRET (Meent, Bronson, and Gonzalez 2014)\n\n\n\nAfter selecting a model, tMAVEN prompts users to determine some parameters for the modelling algorithms that inform the prior. In most cases these settings need not be changed aside from number of states. The parameters asked for might change depending on the model type. The algorithms in tMAVEN use a Gaussian gamma function with: a as the shape parameter, b as the rate parameter of the gamma distribution parameters, beta as the Gaussian precision parameter, and alpha as the sole parameter of the Dirichlet distribution (Bishop 2006).\n\n\nWhen running any model, users also have to input some computational settings (see figure). It is recommended to just leave the defaults. The number of restarts corresponds to the number of times the algorithm will restart with different initializations, in order to ensure this state does not affect the final result. The setting for the convergence determines at what relative change in cost function the algorithm will determine convergence has occurred. In case the convergence doesn’t occur, the algorithm will cut off after the max iterations.\n\n\nGenerating a Threshold Model\nUnder Modeling/FRET Modeling/Threshold is the simplest Model. The threshold model assigns every data point to one of two states dependent on whether it is greater than or less than a user-specified threshold. Threshold models calculate average emission values, means, variances, and fractions of the two states visible in the log.\n\n\nGenerating a Mixture model\nUnder Modeling/FRET/Mixtures are various models that simply cluster the data from all traces either by K-means or by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with either a maximum likelihood (mlGMM) or a variational Bayesian (vbGMM) technique (Bishop 2006). If the number of states is unknown, users can also choose to use model selection (see above) with variational Bayesian (vbGMM + Model Selection). Mixture models calculate average emission values, means, variances, and fractions of k states visible in the log.\n\n\nGenerating a Composite HMM Model\nComposite models under Modeling/FRET Modeling/Composite HMMs create a hidden Markov model (HMM) for each trace and then cluster them in various ways. This single clustered model is then used for the idealized paths shown on each trace.\nTo generate the HMMs, users can choose either a maximum likelihood algorithm (mlHMM, McKinney, Joo, and Ha 2006) or variational Bayesian algorithm (vbHMM, Bronson et al. 2009). If the number of states is unknown, users can also choose to use model selection (see above).\nOnce HMMs have been generated, they are clustered in various ways: K-means, vbGMM and Threshold which have been elaborated above. The means, variances and fractions of the states from the clustered model can be found in the log.\n\n\nGenerating Global HMMs\nvbConsensus (variational Bayesian, TMAVENPAPER?) and ebHMM (empirical Bayesian, Meent, Bronson, and Gonzalez 2014) are both consensus methods, in that they generate one HMM from the entire data set. In addition to means, variances, and fractions, the consensus methods yield a transition matrix, which may be found in the log or under Analyze Dwell Times as discussed below.\n\n\nDwell Time Plots and Analysis\nOnce a model is run and the number states and their means and transition matrices are calculated, tMAVEN can analyze a data set in terms of dwell times. Before analyzing, go to modeling/Analyze Dwell Times, select your model with Change Active and hit calculate (see figure). To look at a graph for the dwell of a specific state, choose the desired state under rate analysis and input whether it is expected to be a single, double, or triple exponential and hit run. Under results, the “Rate type” will read “Dwell Analysis”, and rates and coefficients will be shown according to the form of the equation selected. For instance a double exponential will show two rates and two coefficients according to the equation \\(y=A_1e^{-r_1t}+A_2e^{-r_2t}\\).\n\n\n\nBefore hitting calculate, make sure the intended model is used by looking at “Model Type” in the top left.\n\n\n\n\n\nA dwell time plot with the data in blue and theoretical dwell graph, from model selected as in the preceding figure, as a dotted black line. To change the log scale to linear, search on the left for hist\\(\\_\\)log\\(\\_\\)y. To toggle the model, search for model\\(\\_\\)on. To change which state of the model is displayed, search for dwell\\(\\_\\)state and set to the desired.\n\n\nThen, either navigate to plots/Dwell Times or simply hit Plot in the Dwell Times section of Run Dwell Analysis (see figure). Now that the plot is made (see figure), a histogram of the dwell time is displayed, an exponential decay function. The presets show the y axis on a log scale and the model, theoretical dwell, off. Alter these in the preferences on the left (see figure).\nIf any series do not appear, or do not update when dwell\\(\\_\\)state is changed, navigate back to modeling/analyze dwell times and hit calculate again, turn off and on the active model, or hit refresh in the top left corner of the dwell time plot (see figure).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBishop, Christopher. 2006.

    "text": "Loading Data\ntMAVEN can support ASCII, SMD (Greenfeld et al. 2015 , HDF5 based), raw HDF5, and SPARTAN files. Load data by hitting File/Load, select file type, and then the file itself. Note that class, pre/post etc. files may be uploaded separately. The default upload settings are for SMD format, so if using ASCII files, the upload setting must be chosen through the menus File/Load/Text files (ASCII/UTF)/Raw/[user’s format]. In this section, N refers to number of traces, T to number of time points and C to number of color channels for some N by T by C format. C,T,N is most common format such as in vbFRET (Bronson et al. 2009) and ebFRET (Meent, Bronson, and Gonzalez 2014). Alternatively, if using Raw, users can manually alter settings for uploading under “io.” preferences: Namely, io.axis_order for which [0,1,2] corresponds to [N,T,C]. Decollate_axis (0 or 1) refers to how the text separates individual traces, and the delimiter may be inputed under io.delimiter.\n \nNote that any preferences using True/False are case sensitive. There is also an HDF5 viewer tool under View/ that the user may find useful.\n\n\nThe Molecule Table\nNavigate to the molecule table View/Molecule Table or hit command T to bring up the molecule table. Notice the columns:\n\nClass: the class of the trace, change a trace’s class by clicking its row in the molecule table and inputing a number, or simply by clicking around the plot and keying a number.\nOn/Off: Whether the trace is turned on. By toggling a trace one can easily choose which traces are included in modeling and plotting features, see section 4. It will also toggle whether the trace is subject to actions like save.\nPre/Post: The range of time each cut trace covers\nSource: If modeling from different datasets, the origin of each trace can be seen here. Note that the class can be assigned separately from the source.\n\n\n\n\nMolecule Table Sample\n\n\nClassifying traces is one of the most powerful aspects of tMAVEN.\n\n\nUsing the UI and Cutting a Trace\nNavigate between traces by scrolling while graph window is selected or by using the scroll underneath the graphs (see Figure). Notice trace number and class of the graph displayed in the bottom right corner. Aspects of the graph can be adjusted in the graph settings and figure options (see Figure), or in preferences. Most of these settings are plot.[aspect] and include settings for the axes, subdivision ticks, time scale, and more. The user can always use the View/reset GUI command to set all these settings to default.\n\n\n\nlabeled UI after loading a dataset\n\n\nMost actions in tMAVEN do not alter the raw data of a trace, such as gamma and bleed-through corrections. Only cutting traces actually alters the pre and post times which can be seen in the molecule table or on the traces themselves. The user can set the post time by right clicking at the desired point on a graph or left clicking for the pre time. Notice that once a section has been cut out, it appears much fainter on the graph. Reset the pre and post times for a single trace by hitting R. Users can also use the square brackets to increase and decrease the post time by 1 point.\nOther tools include the pan and zoom features (see Figure). Use the zoom tool to select a section of the graph to enlarge and to allow more precise selection of pre/post time. Additionally, hit G to toggle viewing subdivisions on the graph (settings for these can be altered in preferences as described earlier). Another useful tool is single photobleach detection, which finds and cuts out photobleaching for only the trace shown. Hit P to apply this tool to the shown trace. Photobleach for all traces is also available and is discussed in section 3.5. \nBut before any manual trace picking is done, it is highly recommended that the user employ the preprocessing tools described in section 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBronson, J.

    "text": "The tMAVEN tools allow users to skip a lot of the painful preprocessing by culling bad traces, reordering traces by viability, and adjusting the presentation of those traces without altering the raw data, all of which makes data sets easier to process. These features can be found under “tools”, and all should be considered before trace picking to optimize the process.\n\nSelection\nBefore going through traces users should navigate to tools/ selection/order by/cross-correlation to order traces by cross-correlation since good FRET data corresponds to cross correlated jumps of the donor and acceptor emissions. Notice also the options to order by and Turn on/off by class. One of the greatest strengths of tMAVEN is the ease of classifying and viewing traces with the molecule table (refer to section 2). The power to classify traces greatly enhances use of the algorithms discussed in section 4 by the ease with which one may experiment with inclusion of groups of traces. In this case the user is not forced to go through the whole data set repeatedly. \n\n\nFilter Traces\nThe Filter Traces command, found under tools, allows the user to filter traces by signal to background ratio (SBR). An algorithm that identifies photobleaching (see section 3: Photobleaching) is used to determine the parameters of background. Filter Traces then sorts traces by SBR and allows the user to classify or cull those groups.\n\n\n\nA graph like this is generated once calculate is hit. The actual culling/classifying is not completed until the user hits process (see next figure). The graph enables the user a comprehensive view of their data set\n\n\nCulling in Filter Traces:\n\nOnce calculate is hit and the graph is made, the user can choose what to do with each type of trace (previous figure): ones with low SBR and bleaching, ones with high SBR and bleaching, ones with low SBR and no bleaching, ones with high SBR and no bleaching, and dead traces (traces that bleach before the “minimum frames dead”). Users can repeat the process of filtering and culling until satisfied.\n\n\nCull\nThe Cull function under tools is relatively intuitive and allows users to discard traces according to class or a maximum/minimum data point value. The latter functions should be used only after photobleach detection (see section 3: Photobleaching) lest good traces be culled. The data searched for this function includes only Emissions and not E\\(_{FRET}\\) values.\n\n\nCorrections\nIn this group there are many useful tools such as bleedthrough, gamma, and background correction. As discussed earlier, the actual data is not altered. The program stores a copy of the given data, and the copy is altered by corrections and displayed. For this reason, the corrections should be applied just once for each time a data set is loaded into tMAVEN.\n\n[Bleedthrough corrections] The default bleedthrough correction is set to 5% and can be adjusted in preferences under correction.bleedthrough.\n[Gamma Corrections] The default gamma correction is set to 1 and can be adjusted in preferences under correction.gamma.\n[Background] Background is determined for each trace by the last x frames, alterable in preferences under correction.backgroundframes, and subtracted from the red emission value.\n\n\n\nSignal Filters\nAlso found under tools/corrections are various signal filters that can make traces much easier to read. All smooth the graphs according to different methods, making the E\\(_{FRET}\\) states easier to discern. The filters are found under Tools/Corrections/Signal Filters, and can be removed by resetting corrections under corrections/reset. Reset corrections before switching between signal filters. The width of the filter window’s can also be adjusted in preferences by correction.filterwidth which is automatically set to 2. See figure below for a look at these filters.\n\nGaussian\nWiener\nMedian\n8-pole Bessel\nChung–Kennedy (Chung and Kennedy 1991)\n\n\n\n\nThe visual effect of the signal filters offered by tMAVEN on the same trace (top left). The benefits of different filters and level of smoothing can be seen here. The Chung-Kennedy filter best maintains the sharp transitions while also reducing noise well. In comparison the Gaussian filter is much more rounded, which makes determining transition times harder.\n\n\n\n\nPhotobleaching\nBy navigating to tools/photobleach/photobleach detection, the user can run an algorithm that checks each trace for photobleaching and cuts the trace there. Alternatively, users can hit P and cut only the trace they are looking at. The algorithm essentially identifies transitions by maximizing the evidence of a Gaussian between sections of data and placing transitions between those. Photobleaches are then transitions to mean 0 states.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChung, S. H., and R. A.

    "text": "One-Dimensional Histograms\nThe histogram feature of tMAVEN is primarily useful for visualization of data and not diagnostics. Navigate to Plots/FRET hist 1D to generate a one-dimensional histogram of all E\\(_{fret}\\) emission data, the peaks represent states and should look like K gaussians.\n\n\n\nA typical one dimensional histogram. Note the number of traces used N in the top right. If a model has been calculated, a population-weighted set of emission distributions is plotted as the solid black with the dotted lines as the individual populations. These lines are not a Gaussian fit of the data, but come directly from the models. Theoretically, better models/processing will result in a better fit of the histogram.\n\n\nNotable preferences the user might want to change include:\n\nhist_force_y to force the y axis value\nhist_log_y puts the y-axis in log scale\nmodel_on will toggle the model as described in Figure\nhist_false toggles the histogram itself, blue in the figure\nhist_color will change the color of the histogram\n\nThe save icon below the graph can be used to export the figure.\n\n\nTwo-Dimensional Histograms\nThe two-dimensional histograms in tMAVEN also have the axis of time. Generate by navigating Plots/FRET hist 2D The histogram is automatically smoothed by a median filter which setting can be changed (see below). One of the most useful capabilities is the choice of using post-synchronization. In this case, t=0 represents the time of transition from one specified state to another, see below. Note that post-synch can only operate once a model is run and transitions have been detected.\n\n\n\nA two dimensional histogram with post-sync on using the het color map.\n\n\nUseful preferences:\n\ncolor_ceiling sets the ceiling for the color mapping\ncolor_dbl enables two floors\ncolor_floor_color is the lower floor\ncolor_cmap determines the color map, all matplotlib maps are supported\nhist_smooth_med toggles the use of a median filter on the graph and hist_smoothx/y determine the widths of this filter\ntime_dt changes the time ticks, set to acquisition time to yield the same axis as traces while time_nbins changes the length of time shown.\nhist_normalizeframe will normalize the histogram to mitigate photobleaching or additional transition at different times, see Figure\n\nFor post synchronization, tMAVEN will use the existing model which has identified transitions so users can essentially monitor all traces after a specific transition in a data set. Notice that N, number of traces used, will likely change since not all traces have all transitions. Small n represents the number of transitions measured not number of traces.\n\nsync_postsync toggles post synchronization\nsync_singledwell set to true shows only the dwell before and after transition. In other words, a false setting will also show future transitions.\nsync_hmmstate_1 shows the pretransition state while sync_hmmstate_2 shows the post transition state, input “-1” for any other state\n\n\n\n\nThe same graph as previous figure with normalization on."

The solution is to execute the .maven.emit_data_update() function after any such operation. By default, that function does nothing. However, when a .gui is hooked up to a .maven, the .gui overrides this function with one of its own. This is all automatically handled by the .gui, so all you have to do is call the .maven fxn where your update is complete.\n\n.maven.prefs\nThis is basically a special python dictionary. The big difference is that it maintains the original type of the value for each key. All .maven functions with any user adjustable options should be stored in here.\n\n\n.maven.io\nThis handles all of the loading, saving functions that ultimately go into .maven.smd and .maven.data\n\n\n.maven.smd\nThis object holds all of the ‘raw’ smd format data loaded into .maven. The .maven can only hold one of these. The format is explained a little more in /tmaven/pysmd/readme.md. Largely, after loading data into the smd, you shouldn’t be touching it. Instead you should be using things in .maven.data.\n\n\n.maven.data\nThis object has a maven.data.corrected, which is the main source of data you will be interacting with; it is reset to the .maven.smd.raw. Also, .classes lives in here, and .flag_ons is bool for whether a molecule should be included in an analysis step or not (accessed via .maven.selection.get_toggled_mask)\n\n\n.maven.corrections\nMostly just some helper functions\n\n\n.maven.cull\nMostly just some helper functions\n\n\n.maven.modeler\nThis object holds/manages all the models of the data. It also provides the functionality to make new models and holds onto cached versions of numba JITd functions for later.\nFunctions with the prefix cached_ are generally just models, with no interaction with the .maven. They are called by functions prefixed with run_, which might, for instance, gather the proper traces and collect the EFRET values to model.\nModels are stored in a model_container. These are largely undefined, but have a few requirements to make it worthwhile to switch between them. Basically, they’ll have a .type (identifying string to distinguish the type of model), and them an .idealize function that will be able to idealize the data in .maven.data.corrected. [wait, is this broken?]\n\n\n.maven.scripts\nExecute python scripts. You have a local variable called maven which is the .maven object, so you can operate on anything there.\n\n\n.maven.selection\nMostly just some helper functions. Also, .maven.selection.get_toggled_mask is useful.\n\n\n.maven.trace_filter\nSort of like a stand-alone program that operates by itself\n\n\n.maven.photobleaching\nSort of like a stand-alone program that operates by itself\n\n\n.maven.plots\nThis holds the analysis plots that live in /tmaven/controllers/analysis_plots. These functions take a mpl figure and axis, and work on them to plot the data."

    "text": "The .gui\nThe .gui object is located in /tmaven/interface/main_window.py. It contains maybe objects that hold different things (to keep them organized), that are also found in the /tmaven/interface folder. Generally, the files with a ui_ prefix contain wrapping functions over their .maven counterparts, while the viewer_ prefix files contain unique functionality. For instance, the molecule table in /tmaven/interface/viewer_molecules.py allows you to see a lot of the information in the .maven.data object in a table form, but it’s not operating any (read: much) .maven functionality. Simiarily, the preference viewer in /tmaven/interface/viewer_prefs.py allows you to see the preferences in .maven.prefs (and allows you to change them …). These are in contrast to, say, the functions in ui_cull, which mostly just gather and execute the functions in .maven.cull.\n.gui has access to .maven, because it stores a pointer in .gui.maven\nIt automatically remembers you last mode (ND or smFRET), window size and location, and light or dark mode.\nThere is a trick played to speed up scrolling (using a timer). If you want to change the trace (.gui.index) using the .gui.change_index function to play nice with this trick.\n\n.gui.plot_container\n.gui.plot_container.plot is the mpl canvas for the trace plot the .gui.plot_container controls which canvas is shown (e.g., ND or smFRET) swapping modes in the menu_view also changes some preferences\n\n\n.gui.index\ndenotes the current trace displayed/acted upon\n\n\nmolecule table (command/ctrl + T)\nyou can select things and then use some of the menu items to change things about those traces. the selection menu items will change the selection on this table. For instance, you can select all, and then change the class of the selected.\n\n\npreferences (command/ctrl + P)\nsearch box at the top to narrow it down double click the second column to edit the preference value. After doing so, the .maven should emit a .maven.prefs.emit_changed signal that tells the .gui to update stuff like the plots. This is done automatically and you probably don’t need to worry about it.\n\n\ngui keys\n\n[: descrease post point by one\n]: increase post point by one\nr: reset photobleach of this trace\ng: toggle grid\np: auto photobleach this trace (when sum drops to zero)\nright arrow/down arrow: increase .gui.index\nleft arrow/up arrow: decrease .gui.index\nnumber keys: assigns class to .gui.index trace"
