tMAVEN is a program for analyzing time series data from single-molecule experiments. It is fine-tuned for single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments. The major design goals are to allow for:

* extremely *fast* pre-processing 
* perfectly reproducible figures (*e.g.*, tick locations)
* a one-stop-shop for kinetic modeling
* immutable data -- you only work on a copy of it!
* power-user coding *via* scripts (see Examples pages)

# Who and Where
tMAVEN is a development that came out of the [Gonzalez Biophysics Lab](https://github.com/GonzalezBiophysicsLab) from the [Gonzalez lab at Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html)  from about 2015-present.
