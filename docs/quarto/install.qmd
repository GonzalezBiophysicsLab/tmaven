There are two ways to install tMAVEN. If you aren't going to call tMAVEN functions from within your own scripts, then you should install the standalone binary. *Note: the first time you launch tMAVEN, it might take a while to load as it finds your system's fonts; it's much quicker after that.*

# Install a Standalone Binary
1. Go to the [latest binary release on Github](https://github.com/GonzalezBiophysicsLab/tmaven/releases/latest).
2. Download
    1. The `.dmg` file (Mac).
    2. The `.msi` file (Windows).
3. Double click on the file and follow the directions to install tMAVEN.

**Mac security issue.**

If you try to install on a Mac, you may encounter a security issue that won't allow you to launch tMAVEN because the OS cannot verify that it isn't malware. You need to do the following:

1. Go to the `Apple` menu item
2. Open `System Settings`
3. Go to the `Privacy & Security` tab on the side.
4. Scroll down past the `Privacy` section, and into the `Security` section
5. Find the section that says `tMAVEN was blocked from use becasue it is not from an identified developer.`
6. Click `Open Anyway`

# Install the Python Package
To install tMAVEN from GitHub:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the command:
  ```sh
  pip install git+https://github.com/GonzalezBiophysicsLab/tmaven.git
  ```
3. Once installed, you can launch tMAVEN from your termainal by running the command:
  ```sh
  tmaven
  ```

**Optional: Make Separate Python Environment**

First, create a new conda environment: `conda create -n tmaven python==3.9`. Then, everytime you want to run tMAVEN:

1. Activate your new conda environment:`conda activate tmaven`.
2. Then launch tMAVEN: `tmaven`

Also make sure to activate the environment before you install tmaven using pip!
